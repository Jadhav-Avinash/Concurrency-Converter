A Currency Converter with JavaScript is a web application that allows users to convert values from one currency to another based on the current exchange rates.
Users typically input the amount they want to convert, select the source currency, and choose the target currency. The application then retrieves the latest exchange rates from an API and calculates the converted amount accordingly.
